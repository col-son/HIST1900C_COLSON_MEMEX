### Summary & Key Take Aways

- Cryptology: secret writing and its study
	- close to 3000 years old	
	- almost always appears where writing appears
- plaintext refers to the original message, which is then encoded or encrypted
- one-part code: pairing numbers to words in a single pair of columns to create a code goes back to telegram days, where it was cheaper when charged by the character
- two-part code: uses 2 columns, one for encoding and one for decoding, negates the need to assign words alphabetically to numbers in order
	- this makes it much harder to break the code
- codes require a codebook, which must be the same for all correspondents, and  all must be replaced if leaked
- ciphers confuse me
