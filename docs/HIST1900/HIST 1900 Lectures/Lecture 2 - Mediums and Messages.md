- The medium of a message can change its impact
	- or the nature of it
	- ice age cave messages - the context of them being hidden away, hard to access changes the message
- The medium is the message (JOUR 1001 moment)
- New technologies push away old ones, make them less useful
- Medium is something that carries something else
	- the relationship between medium and message is important
- writing systems: not necessarily written words as typically understood, can come in many forms 
	- come from a need for a system to count
	- a group can have a writing system but still be illiterate, as it is not widely spread? i think that was the point being made?
- Early writing does not necessarily have sounds, requires translation within the mind of a trained scribe
- this plus the fact that writing is done on very stationary stone puts certain people in control of writing and knowledge
- Roman times, a divergence between library and archives emerge
	- as writing becomes more portable, an archive is a place of business, often tied with the mint
	- a library is a place of pleasure
- moveable type allows fast reading, reproduction, and consistency of character forms
	- this allows advancement in literacy and ideas
- Melvil Dewey 1851-1931
	- Creates a system, of ordering based on how important he believes things are
		- this system reflects Dewey's own experiences and perception of the world
		- in very simple terms, this ultimately leaves libraries a reflection of the ideals at Dewey's time
- Library of congress system
	- emerges around the same time, used by academic libraries and reflects more American core ideals
- The original memex article inspires hyperlinks
	- 1965: hypertext where documents referring to it are shown on left, and documents the current one refers to are on the right
		- this project does not take off :(
	- hypertext instead becomes a one-way thing
- There is no one perfect way to classify information, but when someone makes a way, it puts them in a position of power to impose their own worldviews
- digitization is built by people that are used to these accepted systems, thus continuing the same ideas
