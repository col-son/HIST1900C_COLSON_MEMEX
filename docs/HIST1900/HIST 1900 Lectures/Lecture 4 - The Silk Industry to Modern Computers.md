- Western obsession with crediting someone as the first to do something always
	- Does this really matter?
- Evidence of weaving back to the 5th millennium
	- Language surrounding weaving continues to be used in modern technology
- Weaving occurs in the context of many societies
- Weaving is not necessarily tech, it is a social practice allowing further advances
- Silk emerges in Northern China
- No one technology exists in a vacuum, things advance with others and build upon each other
- Spreads to India, desired by the rest of Eurasia
	- Development of the Silk Road, which also spreads other goods, cultures and even disease
- Silk spreads across Europe after monks discover the secret
- Still very rare, only about 2 inches of fabric can be made on a 2-person drawloom per day
- The Silk Industry of Lyon:
	- In the 16th century, Louis XI establishes the silk industry in Lyon
	- Gathers Italian weavers 
	- Workshops within homes are the backbone of the industry
	- Weaving is done by mostly men
	- Still slow by the 18th century, approximately 30k people were employed at its peak
	- Vaucanson, who created automatons, comes up with a way to adapt his technology for silk weaving, but it doesn't catch on
	- Jacquard
		- Counter-revolutionary, who converts when Lyon is taken over by revolutionaries
		- Upon returning to Lyon years later, he is penniless, and the silk industry that his father once worked in is now dead
		  - Using funds from all these weavers out of a job, he creates a new style of loom that uses foot pedals and shows it off at Napoleons 2nd Expo
			  - Takes only one man
			  - Uses cards to replicate patterns
	- Jacquard did not invent punch cards or automatic lifting of threads, simply adapted them 
		- He did invent a method that allows these things to be used together, and that's what is remembered
- From all this, the part that is important in the history of the internet is the cards; an external method to have information stored and repeated at a larger scale
- Charles Babbage
	- Wanted an engine to deal with tables of calculations that previously had to be done by hand
		- Would use intertwined gears and math of differences
		- Does not construct the full machine, only gets about 1/7 through
	- Finds the Jacquard loom and sees it as a way to do more complicated math, and sets out to make a machine using this method instead
	- Uses punched Jacquard cards to allow certain pinwheels to drop and convey information
- Similarly, Korsakov comes up with a way to search info on Jacquard cards but being in Russian in the early 1800s, it doesn't get spread very far
- Herman Hollerith, assisting the U.S census, inspired by his brother's silk business, uses the cards to make data entry easier
	- This involved dropping pins onto cards into mercury pools, which complete a circuit and tabulate the data
	- He goes on to make a company renting these tabulation machines to governments to make data organization easier
- Eventually, this technology was used by IBM and spread to not only governments but businesses, where the real money was
- This gives me the [[Answer to the Francis Bacon Question]] that I brought up in [[Francis Bacon Binary and More?]]
