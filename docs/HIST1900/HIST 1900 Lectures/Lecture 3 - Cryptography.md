- Early cryptology:
	- Caesar shift: Pick a number and shift the letters over by that much
	- Al-Kindi: works out how to decode a Caesar shift by looking at frequencies of characters and correlating them to the language the cipher is based on
	- Roger Bacon: Writes a manuscript describing various forms of encryption, uses very basic grille method himself

	- Francis Bacon (unrelated from Roger Bacon)
		- works out you can make every letter with groups of up to 5 A's and B's
		- essentially the same system as binary code
- Nomenclator
	- A mixture of substitution cyphers and codebooks
	- Still used to early 19 century
	- Susceptible to frequency analysis
- Semaphore telegraph:
	- Towers with arms, used in French revolution. See
