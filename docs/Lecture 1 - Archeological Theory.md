- Jacquard loom punch card: a precursor to the internet
- History of computation largely built on the labour of women

**Archeology is the science of human duration, not necessarily material things**

- Duration - telegram routes -> telephone lines -> fibre optic lines 

**Who are the workers?**

**Space economy**

- Collapsing of space as travel of information/goods becomes easier
- reconfigures perceptions of space and time

**Complex vs Complicated Systems**

- Complex systems can be described without considering the individual aspects involved
	many feedback loops
	i.e the wave, a traffic jam
- Complicated systems; one thing breaks, the entire falls apart
	spaces stations, challenger failure due to single o-ring

**Assemblage Theory**

- Things come together
	- Things have an agency to come together on their own
		- Thing is German: means an assembly or gathering
	- Pottery can be considered an emergent artifact
		The potter's ideas, the clay, and the spin-wheel have all come together to create a new *thing*

**How does Dr. Graham view this?**

- There is always a network between things when there is a relationship, no matter what you choose to call it
	- things emerge from these networks, new structures, new feedback 
- Networks leave a physical trace in the world
- Distinguishing complex vs complicated phenomena is important 
- Networks are answers to questions, and provide a mechanism for computation to happen
